--VIEWS
-- A query that is stored in the database
-- given a name
-- custom table I can create from query
-- so, we can use VIEW just like a table. We can select from a view

-- Create a view that contains all the student names 
Create View StudentNameView 
AS
Select firstName, LastName from student 
go

--Use the view like a table 
Select FirstName + ' ' + LastName 'StudentName' from StudentNameView
GO

--Create a View called InstructorStudentView that allows access to studentID's and Names. 
Create View InstructorsStudentView
AS
Select StudentID, FirstName, LastName from Student
GO

Create View RegistrarView
AS
Select StudentID, FirstName, LastName, StreetAddress, City, Province from Student
GO

--Simplify Complex queries and promote reusability of code
--Write a View called StudentTranscript that contains 
--studentID, FirstName, LastName, CourseId, CourseName, Mark, Staffid, FirstName, LastName, Startdate, EndDate for all Stuents that have taken.
Create View StudentTranscript
AS
Select student.studentID, student.FirstName'StudentFirstName', student.LastName'StudentLastName', course.CourseId, CourseName, Mark, staff.Staffid, staff.FirstName'StaffFirstName', staff.LastName'StaffLastName', Startdate, EndDate from Student
Inner Join registration on Student.StudentID = Registration.StudentID
Inner Join offering on offering.offeringCode=Registration.offeringCode
inner join Staff on Staff.staffID = offering.staffID
inner join course on course.courseID = offering.courseID
inner join semester on semester.semesterCode = offering.semesterCode
go

-- studentID = 199800209
Select * from STudentTranscript
Where studentID = 199899200
go

--Drop View
Drop View StudentTranscript
go

--Retrieve the source code that created the view 
sp_helptext StudentTranscript

--Edit a View 
Alter View StudentTranscript
AS
Select student.studentID, student.FirstName'StudentFirstName', student.LastName'StudentLastName', course.CourseId, CourseName, Mark'Grade', staff.Staffid, staff.FirstName'StaffFirstName', staff.LastName'StaffLastName', Startdate, EndDate from Student
Inner Join registration on Student.StudentID = Registration.StudentID

-- Use the School158 database for this exercise.  If an operation fails write a brief explanation why. Do not just quote the error message genereated by the server!

-- 1.	Create a view of staff full names called staff_list.

-- 2.	Create a view of staff ID's, full names, positionID's and datehired called staff_confidential.

-- 3.	Create a view of student ID's, full names, courseId's, course names, and grades called student_grades.

-- 4.	Use the student_grades view to create a grade report for studentID 199899200 that shows the students ID, full name, course names and marks.

-- 5.	Select the same information using the student_grades view for studentID 199912010.

-- 6.	Using the student_grades view  update the mark for studentID 199899200 in course dmit152 to be 90  and change the coursename to be 'basket weaving 101'.

-- 7.	Using the student_grades view, update the  mark for studentID 199899200 in course dmit152 to be 90.

-- 8.	Using the student_grades view, delete the same record from question 7.

-- 9.	Retrieve the code for the student_grades view from the database.
